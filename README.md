# VR_Project3
### Proposal Phase
## Descriptive Title:
  - Improved Water Elevation
## General Discription: 
  - We will fully adapt our project with the Oculus. We will autogenerate the terrain or add more cities. We will add the yearly saturated thickness data. We will add more prefabs to decorate the terrain. In addition, we will create new buttons to teleport to different wells. We will also add more facts about each city. In addition, we will also add music that people can hear while they are playing because that is an important aspect. The reason why VR is beneficial is that VR allows the user to get a firsthand perspective of the landscape of the city they choose, which fosters an immersive experience. In addition, users can feel a more real experience than looking at a 2D representation by using VR.
## Hardware platform we will use:
  - PC, Oculus rift, Google Cardboard
## Software we will use:
  - Unity
## Teammates:
  - Wenhao Ge, Lino, Kevon
  - Wenhao's role: He will use prefabs to decorate the terrain and add some animations to GameObjects. 
  - Kevonâ€™s role: He will create several buttons to teleport to different wells and do other things.
  - Lino's role: He will do the terrain autogeneration
